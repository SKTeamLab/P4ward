Configure P4ward
================

P4ward has two layers of configuration which control different aspects of the pipeline. One is the run configuration, which is defined by an ``.ini`` file. This file contains all the setting that define the steps of a ternary complex modelling run. View these configurations at :doc:`config_reference`.

The other configuration layer consists of the command line arguments passed to P4ward to control its behaviour outside of the context of a modelling run. Those are for example, the flag to run only linker sampling, or the command to write a default configuration file. More details at :doc:`command_args`.
